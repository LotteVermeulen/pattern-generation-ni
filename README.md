### Notebook
In the `pattern-gen.ipynb` notebook all the code is stored, including setup code. You can simply run that for most appliances.

#### Conversion to GIF
If you have JSON pattern files, you may want to convert them to gif files. To do so:
* **MacOS/Linux**:
Once all the json files are in json/  run ```convert2GIF.bash``` script to output all the GIFs into a GIFS/ subdirectory.
* **Windows:**
The same procedure applies but execute ```convert2GIF.ps1``` using powershell instead of the bash script.
